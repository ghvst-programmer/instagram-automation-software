# SETUP GUIDE
- Download python on your windows or Mac
- Download an IDE like Visual Studio COde
- Open your vscode terminal
- create a project folder
- copy and paste the pyc script in this repository to your folder
- save the pyc script
- run the following commands in your terminal:
- pip install instagrapi
- pip install tkinter
- pip install PyInstaller
- Then run the command to compile your pyc script to exe for windows or dmg for Mac
- python3 -m pyinstaller --onefile script_name.pyc - this is for mac, rename the pyc file name to waht you have
- pyinstaller --onefile script-name.pyc - this is for windows, rename the pyc file name to what you have

  You would see an executable file in the "dist" folder in your project folder. if you want an executable for windows, run the setup process on your windows and if you want the executable for Mac, run the setup process on your Mac.
